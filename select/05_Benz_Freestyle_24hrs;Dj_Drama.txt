The fuck you mean you don't know-
West side shawty, she gon' fuck with me
South side shawty, she gon' fuck with me
Yeah, yeah

She wanna fuck me, stay the night, she want my LS hoodie
At 12 AM in Calabasas tryna fuck on something
That .38 is just for show, he ain't gon' bust on nothing
In the back seat of the Maybach eatin' onion rings
It's like 50 on my chain, 20 on my ring
For a feature you can't talk to me, need big flex
My nigga Ra got the rollie, talking crip face
In the wagon got the script she used to fuck with me
And my bitch, she fuck with 20 'cause she been a 10
Say she hungry, we hit Busy Bees and smoke again
Don't you get no lipstick on the seats in this new Benz
I wan' fuck you in the backseat, this a Benz
Ridin' through Atlanta in this brand new Benz
We go hit the limits in this brand new Benz
So much Fendi in this trunk, that's in this brand new Benz
IPod smelling like some gas, that's a brand new Benz

Brand new Benz, brand new Benz
Please don't waste no liquor in this brand new Benz
Brand new Benz, brand new Benz
I wan' fuck you and your friend in my brand new Benz
Brand new Benz, brand new Benz
I just smoked like a half, I popped a perc, 10
Brand new Benz, brand new Benz
It's a brand new Benz
