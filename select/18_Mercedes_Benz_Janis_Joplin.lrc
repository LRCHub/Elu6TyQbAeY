[00:00.88] I'd like to do a song of great social and political import
[00:05.11] It goes like this
[00:13.61] 
[00:10.46] Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?
[00:16.45] My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends
[00:22.16] Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends
[00:27.92] So, oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?
[00:51.42] 
[00:33.45] Oh Lord, won't you buy me a color TV?
[00:38.83] Dialing For Dollars is trying to find me
[00:44.22] I wait for delivery each day until three
[00:49.94] So, oh, Lord, won't you buy me a color TV?
[01:10.94] 
[00:55.10] Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a night on the town?
[01:00.90] I'm counting on you Lord, please don't let me down
[01:06.41] Prove that you love me and buy the next round
[01:11.83] Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a night on the town?
[01:16.83] Everybody
[01:21.33] 
[01:17.80] Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?
[01:22.58] My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends
[01:27.77] Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends
[01:32.95] So, oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?
[01:55.95] 
[01:41.50] That's it
